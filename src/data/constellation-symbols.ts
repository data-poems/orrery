/*
 * Zodiac glyphs — Unicode astrological symbols (♈♉♊♋♌♍♎♏♐♑♒♓).
 *
 * Earlier revisions of this file shipped hand-traced SVG bezier paths for each
 * sign; that approach drifted from the canonical glyph shapes (Pisces, Cancer,
 * Capricorn each had to be re-fixed at one point) so we now render the
 * Unicode characters directly. The font stack in `src/scene/Stars.tsx` picks
 * a symbol font that contains the zodiac block; the bezier-path rendering is
 * gone.
